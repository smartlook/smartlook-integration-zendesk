# Smartlook

Smartlook is a simple tool which records the screens of real users on your website. You can see what visitors clicked with their mouse, what they filled into a form field, where they spend most of their time, and how they browse through each page.

## See visitor behavior in a video
Play video recordings of visitors and see what they actually do on your website.  The Smartlook App for Zendesk is suitable for your support staff while troubleshooting customer issues. It gets you unique insight into what happened before and after a user submitted Zendesk ticket. They will never need to ask for more information.

## Visitor journey
Smartlook shows all recordings of a visitor in one place. This gives you greater insight and context about the visitor’s behavior. E.g. a visitor came to your website from a Google ad and browsed a few products. Two days later he came back via your Facebook post and finished the purchase.

## Share insights with your team
When you discover bad user experience on your website, simply send a link with the recording to your UX designer or developer, so everyone can see what the issue is.
